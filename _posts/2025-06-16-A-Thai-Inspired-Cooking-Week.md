## Monday:
### Morning:
Steamed 2 frozen chinese milk buns and ate it with coconut jam which is a southeast asian speciality. We flew to Seattle last weekend for my nephew's college graduation ceremony and visited Starbucks reserve roastery. It's a pretty cool place and we enjoyed the coffee cocktails. I made pour-over coffee with frothed milk and somehow it tasted better when drank from the new sleek looking mugs that we bought from Starbucks roastery. Today morning's dance fitness class was especially fun as the intructor picked a few folks to lead each dance. We've done the same routines many times so most of us know it by heart. I got picked for my favorite routine and dancing in front of the class made me dance with a lot more energy that usual, I was high on adrenaline for the rest of the class after my routine was over.  
Did a quick Trader Joe's run. **$13.77**

### Noon:  
Met up with a girl friend for lunch and had fun catching up with her. I really love the carribean vibe and open air seating with all the lush greenery and shaded areas at the restaurant, I felt like I was on vacation somewhere far away. I will come back here again for half off Taco Tuesdays for date night with my honey. Half off all margaritas and small bites every monday so I ordered a passionfruit mango margarita.  Ordered 2 small bites with carne asada and grilled shrimp on the side (**$21.86**).

*Monday Lunch: Lunch with girl friend at a carribean restaurant*

### Afternoon:
After lunch I watched a couple episodes of an anime series called "Spy x Family" and then worked on this website to host my weekly food journals. Got sleepy and took a nice 1 hour nap. 

### Evening:
I have been following this Thai lady on YouTube called "ThaiFood Chef". I've made several of her recipes and they are all simple and delicious. Today I made Thai Grilled Pork Salad which is spicy, sour, sweet and umami. It was just an explosion of flavor and so fresh tasting from the herbs. I also added some cherry tomatoes from our garden and each of them is like a flavor bomb. It's going to be hard to go back to store bought tomatoes after this. For vegetables I made a simple dashi soup with tofu, carrots and chrysanthemum greens. For once we didn't play pickleball after dinner so I decided to hand wash my car. I don't do it very often but I must say it's very satisfying to see my car so clean and knowing that I did it.

## Tuesday:
### Morning:
I made omelette with our home grown cherry tomatoes and trader joe's ciabatta. Went to Winco and spent **$59.50** on bulk bin snacks, canned beans, chicken thighs and chicken wings, pork sirloin, canned oranges, limes, lemons, blackberries etc. It's enough to last us the whole week and I still have a lot of vegetables which I bought from my last asian grocery store run 2 days before the start of this food journal week. 

*Tuesday Breakfast: Homegrown tomatoes omelette*

### Noon:
Made a quick stir fry of snow peas, shiitake mushrooms with pork. Ate it with steamed white rice. It's very simple and easy to make but we always enjoy this kind of stir fries.

### Afternoon:
I spent some time researching online for two things. First was to look for a facial place. I found one that looks promising and it offers a membership which allows you to get a 25% - 40% discount on all services if you go in once a month. I plan to do a monthly facial anyway. The second topic was how to hem my tshirts and tops. I like my tops to fall down to my waist, above the waist band of my bottoms. I could get it altered, but at $15 per alteration, that would quickly add up plus the tailor would probably think I'm nuts to alter a tshirt. I found this iron-on hemming tape and I ordered some and cannot wait for it to arrive. If it works then I will hem most of my tshirts and tops. That will be quite a project as I have so many, especially work out tops. It's funny how easy it is to look for projects to work on when you have all this time in the world. Spent another 30 minutes writing this weekly journal. Took a 90 minute nap. 

### Evening:
Quick run to Safeway to get corns (8 for $1) and cheez-it while he made dinner for us tonight, baked cod. I also made a quick chrysanthemum greens soup with corn. It's rare that he cooks for us but he does all of the cleaning, and I do most of the cooking, which makes us a perfect match. It's adorable to see him cook as he does get flustered whereas for me cooking puts me into a meditative state. After dinner we played pickleball with another couple at our club, very fun with long rallies. It's so nice to not to have to wait for courts unlike playing at the public park, the only problem is we do have to schedule games otherwise there won't be anyone to play with.
Another pit stop at Safeway to pick up some sorbet as he was craving something cold and sweet. Safeway is a great place to shop if you buy their weekly sale items, I always take the time to go through their weekly ads and stock up on their sale items.

## Wednesday:
### Morning:
Harvested more cherry tomatoes this morning. It's been producing about a pint every three days from our two plants. Made tomato and bacon omelette with toast for breakfast before going to my bollyx zumba class. Did a quick stop at Ross which is close to the gym. I enjoy going to Ross on weekday mornings right when it opens (9 am) as it's not crowded and no wait in the self service fitting room. I love buying active wear at Ross but came out of the store empty handed today.  I came across a black bean brownie recipe on reddit and was intrigued. I made it and it was surprisingly yummy and moist. 

*Wednesday Snack: Black bean brownie - Canned black beans, brownie mix, egg, instant coffee, walnuts*

### Noon:
Lunch is a simple stir fried pork with ginger and green onions and rice. I was too lazy to make a second dish of vegetables stir fry so I served lunch with more of the cherry tomatoes. Had vanilla ice cream with a piece of the black bean brownie I made this morning. Very yummy and we don't have to feel too guilty as the brownie is high in fiber and protein.

*Our "sweet 100" and "sungold" cherry tomato plants*

### Afternoon:
More writing of this food journal entry. I think writing is good for me, it uses a different part of my brain and I feel accomplished after writing. One episode of Spy X Family and another 1 hour nap.

### Evening:
Made a very soul soothing Thai chicken curry rice noodle soup. Garnished with kaffir lime leaves, boiled egg, crushed peanuts, fried shallots, green onions which made it extra special. Pickleball at our private club after dinner. We had 3 good games against 2 other guys, we were tied at 1-1 but lost our rubber match 14 to 12. Very close game and lots of great rallies. Still I was pretty bummed by our 3rd match loss. I have a very stress free life and generally feel joyful, but losing in pickleball knocks a few points off although winning increases it. Consoled myself this evening by eating a big bowl of my asian sweet soup dessert. We watched half a movie, "A few good men" and will finish the rest tomorrow. We've been on a binge recently to watch movies from the 80s and 90s.

## Thursday:
### Morning:
Woke up extra early today at 6ish am. Did some redditing and got up to make a small breakfast of toast with gouda cheese. Spent 30 minutes pruning our two tomato plants. It's very therapeutic. Harvested another big bowl of cherry tomatoes. I've been thinking of how to better organize our spice and condiments and I found this acrylic lazy susan that should fit in the cabinets perfectly. I ordered a pack o 4 and can't wait for it to arrive tomorrow. I hemmed one of my tshirt using the hemming tape and it looks awesome! Finally I can customize the length I want. It was quite easy and took about 20 minutes. Let's see if it stays put after washing and drying it. I know he will sleep in so I went to TJ Maxx. Bought two capri tights and one maxi skirt, but I will return the capris as it bunches up behind my knee.
Picked up a big pack of London Broil beef from Safeway (on sale for $3.99/lb) for dinner with his family tomorrow evening. It's his sister's birthday celebration.

### Noon:
Got home too late to make mexican shredded chicken, a new recipe I had been wanting to try. So I took half a pound of the flank steak, seasoned it with garlic salt pepper blend and grilled it for a couple minutes on each side on a grill pan in our backyard. Luckily I had prepped a corn, black bean and tomato salad already yesterday and still had some leftover rice. Lunch was pretty delicious and came together in under 15 minutes.

## Afternoon:
He did a few laundry loads of bedsheets and towels and mopped the floors. We live in a very clean and minimalist house, it always feel so zen here, I love it. I folded the laundry and did more writing and watched an episode of Spy x Family. 10 minute meditation followed by a 2 hour nap as I woke up too early this morning.

## Evening
Tried to make an indian chicken curry dish and of all the cuisines I've tried, I have the lowest success with indian. I shouldn't have used our overly flavorful homegrown sungold cherry tomatoes in the curry dish and it made it tastes very fruity and looks bright yellow. It's not bad but nothing at all how it should look and taste like. Made a side salad of boiled and lightly seasoned chrystanthemum greens. It's a very windy evening so no pickleball tonight. We decided to check out a bowling alley/axe throwing place, didn't play any games but we might for next date night. Strolled around Target to get some steps in. Finished the second half of "A few good men". Jack Nicholson makes such a good villain and I really enjoyed the last 15 minutes of the courtroom drama and I want to rewatch just that part again. I love how a good movie makes me feel, it's so satisfying.
