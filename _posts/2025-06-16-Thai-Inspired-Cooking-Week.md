## Morning:  
Steamed 2 frozen chinese milk buns and ate it with coconut jam which is a southeast asian speciality. We flew to Seattle last weekend for my nephew's college graduation ceremony and visited Starbucks reserve roastery. It's a pretty cool place and we enjoyed the coffee cocktails. I made pour-over coffee with frothed milk and somehow it tasted better when drank from the new sleek looking mugs that we bought from Starbucks roastery. Today morning's dance fitness class was especially fun as the intructor picked a few folks to lead each dance. We've done the same routines many times so most of us know it by heart. I got picked for my favorite routine and dancing in front of the class made me dance with a lot more energy that usual, I was high on adrenaline for the rest of the class after my routine was over.  

*Day 1 Breakfast: Steamed milk bun with coconut jam*

## Noon:  
Met up with a girl friend for lunch and had fun catching up with her. I really love the carribean vibe and open air seating at the restaurant, I felt like I was on vacation somewhere far away. I will come back here again for half off Taco Tuesdays for date night with my honey. Half off all margaritas and small bites every monday so I ordered a passionfruit mango margarita.  Ordered 2 small bites with carne asada and grilled shrimp on the side (**$21.86**).

*Day 1 Lunch: Lunch with girl friend at a carribean restaurant*

## Afternoon:
After lunch I watched a couple episodes of an anime series called "Spy x Family" and then worked on this website to host my weekly food journals. Got sleepy and took a nice 1 hour nap. 

## Evening:
I have been following this Thai lady on YouTube called "ThaiFood Chef". I've made several of her recipes and they are all simple and delicious. Today I made Thai Grilled Pork Salad which is spicy, sour, sweet, umami. It was just an explosion of flavor and fresh tasting from the herbs. I also added some cherry tomatoes from our garden and each of them is like a flavor bomb. It's going to be hard to go back to store bought tomatoes after this. For vegetables I made a simple dashi soup with tofu, carrots and chrysanthemum greens. For once we didn't play pickleball after dinner so I decided to hand wash my car. I don't do it very often but I must say it's very satisfying to see my car so clean and knowing that I did it. 


# Day 1 Total For Food: $35.63

# Day 2:

## Morning:
I made omelette with our home grown cherry tomatoes and trader joe's ciabatta. Went to Winco and did a $59.60 run. Too lazy to type out everything, but it's our usual bulk bin snacks, canned beans, chicken thighs and chicken wings, pork sirloin, canned oranges, limes, lemons etc. It's enough to last us the whole week and I still have a lot of vegetables which I bought from my last asian grocery store run 2 days before the start of this food journal week. 

## Noon:

## Afternoon:
I spent some time researching online for two things. First was to look for a facial place. I found one that looks promising and it offers a membership which allows you to get a 40% discount on all services if you go in once a month. I plan to do a monthly facial anyway. The second topic was how to hem my tshirts and tops. I like my tops to fall down to my waist, above the waist band of my bottoms. One idea is to go to get it altered, but at $15 per alteration, that would quickly add up plus my tailor would probably think I'm nuts to alter a t shirt. I found this iron-on hemming tape and I ordered some and cannot wait for it to arrive. If it works then I will hem most of my tshirts and tops. That will be quite a project as I have so many, especially work out tops. It's funny how easy it is to look for projects to work on when you have all this time in the world. 

## Evening:
He made dinner for us tonight, baked cod. I made a vegetable soup with corn. It's rare that he cooks for us as he does all of the cleaning, and I do most of the cooking, which makes us a perfect match. It's adorable to see him cook as he does get flustered wheras for me cooking puts me into a meditative state. We played pickleball with another couple at our club, very fun with long rallies. It's so nice to not to have to wait for courts unlike playing at the public park, the only problem is we do have to schedule games otherwise there will not be people to play with.

# Day 2 Total For Food: $35.63

# Day 3:
## Morning:
Harvested more cherry tomatoes this morning. It's been producing about a pint every other day from our two plants. Made tomato omelette with toast for breakfast before going to my bollyx zumba class. I came across a black bean brownie recipe on reddit and I was intrigued. I made it and it was surprisingly yummy and moist. 

*Day 3 Snack: Black bean brownie - Canned black beans, brownie mix, egg, instant coffee, walnuts*

## Noon:
Lunch is a simple stir fried pork with ginger and green onions and rice. I was too lazy to make a second dish of vegetables stir fry so I served lunch with more of the cherry tomatoes. Had vanilla ice cream with a piece of the black bean brownie I made this morning. Very delicious and don't have to feel to guilty as the brownie is high in fiber and protein.

*Our "sweet 100" and "sungold" cherry tomato plants*

# Day 3 Total For Food: $0

Day 4:

Breakfast:
I baked the french toast casserole which had been sitting in the fridge overnight. The mini loaf pan is so adorable! It was a genius idea to add the pistachio ice cream, it turned out delicious and we both loved it. 

Lunch:
I made fettuccine pasta with oyster mushrooms, spicy italian sausage and blue cheese and cream cheese sauce. Simple but flavorful.

Dinner:
I made pan fried pork marinated in Indonesian sweet soy sauce, lime juice, coriander powder, thai chili and ginger. Second dish is bitter melon and eggs, this isn’t for everyone. I love bitter melons but he doesn’t. Ate with steamed white rice.

Late night snack:
We played pickleball after dinner at an indoor club 40 minutes away from home and got home late and was hungry. I had prepped another mini loaf of french toast just before dinner and I popped it in the toaster oven while we took a shower. Freshly baked warm french toast with Haagen Dazs Coffee Chocolate Brownie ice cream, a heavenly match. We definitely got our money's worth out of the Safeway $2 french bread.

Breakfast:
I boiled some Hawaiian purple potatoes that we bought last week. These are the most gorgeous dark purple and are sweet. It gave me plenty of energy to do my aerobics step class. Did a trader joe’s run after class ($18.40), no wait at the cashier. 

Lunch:
I made a sort of Japanese Bento style lunch. Pan fried sake and mirin steelhead trout, leftover chrysanthemum green salad and pork, and miso seaweed soup served with steamed rice. Cara cara oranges for dessert. He really loved this lunch, I always love hearing his compliments.

Dinner:
We had an early dinner at a taqueria. I love their unlimited tortilla chips bar with all the different salsas, especially their nopales salad. It was happy hour prices and the total came to **$22.03**.

Late night snack:
I made a Chinese style dessert which will probably seem a bit strange to most people. Typically it’s made using soy milk or water sweetened with rock sugar but we prefer oat milk. All you have to do is add a bunch of toppings to the milk and we used almond jelly, hawaiian purple potato, canned orange segments and crushed ice. Summer is here and we definitely will be making more of this type of dessert.

One Trader Joe’s hash brown, one egg and cheese each. We made the 40 minute drive again to the indoor pickleball club. The pickleball community here is small and we always meet familiar faces and it’s fun to have small chats here and there.  

Lunch:
We ate at a food court close to the pickleball club and each had a bowl of Guilin style chinese noodles (**$34.32**). We bumped into another pickleball couple while eating there and had a quick friendly chat. Pickleball has indeed added so much fun to our lives. There’s an asian grocery store nearby and we do another quick run for the family dinner (**$34.22**) that I will be cooking for tomorrow (7 people). 

Afternoon snack:
He made us a mixed berries smoothie. Perfect for a hot afternoon.

Dinner:
Made 2 dishes with steamed rice. First is stir fried cabbage with bacon with szechuan chili oil and black vinegar. Very simple but we both really loved it. Ginger pork with onions, a bit too heavy on the ginger.

Late night snack:
Another one of our cold chinese sweet soup desserts, this time we used oat milk with canned rambutan, almond jelly, canned oranges and a splash of elderberry liquor.

Spent the morning cooking for the family dinner tonight (for 7 people) while he did his weekly house cleaning. He enjoys cleaning as much as I love cooking. I have never been to a house cleaner or more minimalistic than ours.  Lunch is just a small meal of leftover rice and leftover ginger pork. He did weight lifting while I took a yoga class at the gym. A power nap before  an early dinner with the family. 

Dinner:
We brought the food to his parents house and reheated the food there. I made egg tofu with eggs and mushrooms, black pepper beef with green peppers, chipotle shrimp, chrysanthemum greens salad, boiled corn. We ate it with steamed rice. His sister bought taiyaki from Somi somi and wine. I loved the taiyakis. Everyone enjoyed the food and we finished everything.
