|Trader Joe's||
| --- | --- |
|Oatmilk (2 qt)|$3.99|
|Half and half (1 pint)|$1.99|
|Frozen hash browns (10 pc)|$2.99|
|Milk(1 qt) |$1.49|

## Breakfast:  
Steamed 2 frozen chinese milk buns and ate it with coconut jam which is a southeast asian speciality. We flew to Seattle for my nephew's college graduation ceremony and visited Starbucks reserve roastery. It's a pretty cool place and we enjoyed the coffee cocktails. We bought two sleek looking starbucks mugs as a souvenir. I made pour-over coffee with frothed milk and somehow it tasted better when drank from the new mugs. Today morning's dance fitness class was especially fun as the intructor picked a few folks to lead each dance. We've done the same routines many times so most of us know it by heart. Somehow standing in front of the class made me dance really hard, I was high on adrenaline for the rest of the class after my routine was over.  

**Lunch**:  
Met up with a girl friend for lunch and had fun catching up with her. I really love the carribean vibe and open air seating at the restaurant, I felt like I was on vacation somewhere far away. I will come back here again for Taco Tuesdays for date night with my honey. Half off all margaritas and small bites every monday so I ordered a passionfruit mango margarita.  Ordered 2 small bites with carne asada and grilled shrimp the side (**$21.86**).

## Dinner:
I have been following this thai lady on youtube called "ThaiFood Chef". I've made several of her recipes and they are all simple and delicious. Today I made Thai Pork Salad which is spicy, sour, sweet and herby, it was just an explosion of flavor and freshness. I also added some cherry tomatoes from our garden and each of them is like a flavor bomb. It's going to be hard to go back to store bought tomatoes after this. For vegetables I made a simple dashi soup with tofu, carrots and chrysanthemum greens. For once we didn't play pickleball after dinner so I decided to hand wash my car. I don't do it very often but I must say it's very satisfying to see my car so clean and knowing that I did it. 

***Day 1 Total: $35.63***

Day 2:

Breakfast:
I made omelette with our home grown cherry tomatoes and trader joe's ciabatta. Went to Winco and did a $59.60 run. Too lazy to type out everything, but it's our usual bulk bin snacks, canned beans, chicken thighs and chicken wings, pork sirloin, canned oranges, limes, lemons etc. It's enough to last us the whole week and I still have a lot of vegetables which I bought from my last asian grocery store run 2 days before the start of this food journal week.

***Day 2 Total: $12***

Day 3:

Went to Safeway twice today.

|Safeway||
| --- | --- |
|French bread |$2|
|Ice cream |$6|
|Safeway Total |$8|

Breakfast:
I had a small bowl of heritage cereal (Trader Joe’s) and almond granola (Winco bulk bin) with oat milk before my bollywood zumba class this morning. Stopped by Safeway after class to pick up a loaf of french bread ($2) for lunch. He skipped breakfast and only had a cup of keurig coffee, which costs about $0.40 per pod. We buy it in bulk on sale from [Staples.com](http://Staples.com), free delivery. 

Lunch:
I made italian sausages with onions and bell peppers and canned tomatoes. I love this brand called “New York Style Sausage Company” and it was on sale for 2 packs for $8 at Safeway last week. That’s 10 sausages and I usually use 2-3 sausages per meal so that $8 will last us for 3 meals. I made 2 big sandwiches with it and sprinkled feta cheese and parsley on top. It was very delicious and filling. Made myself a pour-over coffee with frothed milk.

Late night snack:
We only played 4 games of pickleball this evening at our private club but they were really good games with lots of rallies. I was the only female and we played against 3 different mens teams. We won the last 3 games and felt really happy with the way we played and decided we deserve a treat and bought ourselves some Haagen Dazs ice cream at Safeway. They were on sale for $3 per pint. We got pistachio and coffee chocolate brownie ice cream. We had a scoop of each with some almond granola. 

I also prepared a mini loaf of french toast using the leftover french bread and added a couple scoops of the pistachio ice cream for breakfast tomorrow.

***Day 3 Total: $8***

Day 4:

Breakfast:
I baked the french toast casserole which had been sitting in the fridge overnight. The mini loaf pan is so adorable! It was a genius idea to add the pistachio ice cream, it turned out delicious and we both loved it. 

Lunch:
I made fettuccine pasta with oyster mushrooms, spicy italian sausage and blue cheese and cream cheese sauce. Simple but flavorful.

Dinner:
I made pan fried pork marinated in Indonesian sweet soy sauce, lime juice, coriander powder, thai chili and ginger. Second dish is bitter melon and eggs, this isn’t for everyone. I love bitter melons but he doesn’t. Ate with steamed white rice.

Late night snack:
We played pickleball after dinner at an indoor club 40 minutes away from home and got home late and was hungry. I had prepped another mini loaf of french toast just before dinner and I popped it in the toaster oven while we took a shower. Freshly baked warm french toast with Haagen Dazs Coffee Chocolate Brownie ice cream, a heavenly match. We definitely got our money's worth out of the Safeway $2 french bread. 

***Day 4 Total: $0***

Breakfast:
I boiled some Hawaiian purple potatoes that we bought last week. These are the most gorgeous dark purple and are sweet. It gave me plenty of energy to do my aerobics step class. Did a trader joe’s run after class ($18.40), no wait at the cashier. 

Lunch:
I made a sort of Japanese Bento style lunch. Pan fried sake and mirin steelhead trout, leftover chrysanthemum green salad and pork, and miso seaweed soup served with steamed rice. Cara cara oranges for dessert. He really loved this lunch, I always love hearing his compliments.

Dinner:
We had an early dinner at a taqueria. I love their unlimited tortilla chips bar with all the different salsas, especially their nopales salad. It was happy hour prices and the total came to **$22.03**.

Late night snack:
I made a Chinese style dessert which will probably seem a bit strange to most people. Typically it’s made using soy milk or water sweetened with rock sugar but we prefer oat milk. All you have to do is add a bunch of toppings to the milk and we used almond jelly, hawaiian purple potato, canned orange segments and crushed ice. Summer is here and we definitely will be making more of this type of dessert.

Breakfast:
One Trader Joe’s hash brown, one egg and cheese each. We made the 40 minute drive again to the indoor pickleball club. The pickleball community here is small and we always meet familiar faces and it’s fun to have small chats here and there.  

Lunch:
We ate at a food court close to the pickleball club and each had a bowl of Guilin style chinese noodles (**$34.32**). We bumped into another pickleball couple while eating there and had a quick friendly chat. Pickleball has indeed added so much fun to our lives. There’s an asian grocery store nearby and we do another quick run for the family dinner (**$34.22**) that I will be cooking for tomorrow (7 people). 

Afternoon snack:
He made us a mixed berries smoothie. Perfect for a hot afternoon.

Dinner:
Made 2 dishes with steamed rice. First is stir fried cabbage with bacon with szechuan chili oil and black vinegar. Very simple but we both really loved it. Ginger pork with onions, a bit too heavy on the ginger.

Late night snack:
Another one of our cold chinese sweet soup desserts, this time we used oat milk with canned rambutan, almond jelly, canned oranges and a splash of elderberry liquor.

Lunch:
Spent the morning cooking for the family dinner tonight (for 7 people) while he did his weekly house cleaning. He enjoys cleaning as much as I love cooking. I have never been to a house cleaner or more minimalistic than ours.  Lunch is just a small meal of leftover rice and leftover ginger pork. He did weight lifting while I took a yoga class at the gym. A power nap before  an early dinner with the family. 

Dinner:
We brought the food to his parents house and reheated the food there. I made egg tofu with eggs and mushrooms, black pepper beef with green peppers, chipotle shrimp, chrysanthemum greens salad, boiled corn. We ate it with steamed rice. His sister bought taiyaki from Somi somi and wine. I loved the taiyakis. Everyone enjoyed the food and we finished everything. 

***Day 7 Total: $5.28***

***This Week's Grand Total: $108 groceries, $56 eating out = $164***

We hosted a big party a few weeks ago and I enjoyed cooking for the party. We had our guests bring beverages and desserts and everyone had a great time. We plan to host more house parties in the future and we are happy to increase our grocery bills for the parties.
